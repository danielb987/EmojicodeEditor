# EmojicodeEditor AAA
A text editor and IDE written in Java f√∂r Emojicode

Emojicode is an open-source, full-blown programming language consisting of emojis.
But it can be hard to read for new users and it can be difficult to know which
emojis to use.

The subject of this project is to create a text editor which fully understands
Emojicode and supports the software developer in creating software with Emojicode.

### Debugger
One important feature of IDE:s is to have a debugger. Therefore EmojicodeEditor
includes a compiler and debugger to let the user run the program step by step
and watch the status of the variables. The native compiler for Emojicode doesn't
support debugging of the program at this point, so EmojicodeEditor has its own
compiler and debugger.
